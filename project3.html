							<h1>3D printer</h1>
							<p>Assignment 3 consisted of 2 parts. Firstly, the students were to make a drawing in a software of their own choice that should then be 3D printed in Fab Lab. First they pick a printer and do a test that should reveal the constraint on their design. That is how detailed the design can be in relation to angles, thickness and so on. Furthermore it should not have been possible to use the method of milling to make it. Secondly the students were to  3D scan something. </p>
                            
                            <h2> Staupajafnari </h2>
                            <p>Again, I wanted to make something that I could make use of. Around the time of assignment 3 the student association began to sell tickets to their annual festival. This idea came right away 
                            and I simply opened Fusion 360 and began drawing where I had a rather clear idea of the design. It took a couple of tries before I was satisfied but here you can see the final outcome. This is a device that pours equally into 4 shot glasses at a time. </p>

                            height="350"/> </center>
                            
                            <h2>Design process</h2>
                            
                            <p>I wanted to keep the design simple and clean but it was harder to achieve than I had expected. As I mentioned earlier I tried a few designs before I came up with the one I was satisfied with. Here below you can see one of these designs but the difference is that the arms that guide the liquor into the glasses are located on different  parts of the main body. Looking back, I see that that design could have been more successful than the one I chose. That will be discussed in the result part. </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/1_utgafa.png" width="500" 
                            height="300"/> </center>       
                            
                            <p>The way I drew this particular design is similar to the way I drew the one I picked in the end but this is done with the revolve method. The picture below describes it best.  </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/revolve.png" width ="500" 
                            height="250"/></center>
                            
                            <p>This is a clever feature when you want to design your own form, it can go from a very basic cylinder to a complexed form in a simple way. Like I said before I wanted to keep the design simple and clean so all the designs I tried were rather basic like the one here above. 
                            I chose a slightly different shape than the cylinder, like you can see in the pictures below. In this edition the arms simply come down from the bottom side. When I had made the body I drew four circles on the bottom side and used the cut extrude feature to make holes for the arms. To make the arms I made another sketch where I drew circles with the same diameter as the holes and used the extrude feature again, now “extrude from surface” instead of the “cut extrude” feature. The final touch was a cone situated inside the body, between the holes for the arms. The cone should guide all of the liquor into the arms so no liquor would remain in the body. Here below is a picture of the design where it is possible to see all parts.</p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/gegnsae.png" width ="300" 
                            height=300/></center>
                            
                            <h2>Printer test</h2>
                            <p>I performed the 3D printer test with Íris and Guðný, but that part of the project was posted on Íris’s website. We chose the Prusa MK3+ printer and performed the test on that particular printer. <a href="https://irisben.github.io/sida/nysida3.html?fbclid=IwAR2G3XjdgCgf6wOEPqv4rZxfYbX4piEaa3oSzSRf7MFy45YnXrD7xjFhiWw">Here</a>  you can read about the testing process. As I mentioned earlier, one of the pros of this design is its simplicity. What I took from the testing was safety measures regarding thickness and allowable angles so the design would not fail in the printing. The latter one is not relevant for the final design but originally I wanted the arms of the staupamælir to be wavy. </p>
                            
                            <h2>Preperation and printing</h2>
                            <p>As mentioned before, the name of the printer I chose was the Prusa MK3+ printer. At the time I printed my design there was only one type of material available,  PETG or Polyethylene terephthalate glycol, which is thermoplastic polyester. It was convenient, because PETG is an optimal choice when liquids are involved where it does not leak. <a href="https://lairdplastics.com/blog/what-is-petg/#:~:text=PETG%20or%20Polyethylene%20terephthalate%20glycol,beverage%20bottles%20and%20food%20products.">Here</a>  it is possible to get information about this material as well as a comparison to other materials used in 3D printing. It is worth mentioning that the PET component is commonly found in plastic beverage bottles and food products, which is highly relative for this design, but the glycol adds strength and durability. The button below takes you to a site that contains information about the printer. </p>
                            
                            <center><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/" class="button" target = "_blank">Prusa MK3+</a></center>
                            
                            <p>When the drawing was ready in Fusion 360 I took my computer to Fab Lab where Hafliði, the teacher of the course, helped me to prepare my design for the printing. Here I will not go into this part of the process in detail, mainly because I have no pictures to show. On my computer I saved the file containing my design as a 3MF file which I then  moved to the computer in Fab Lab via USB. The file was opened in the computer where a few things needed to be adjusted before the printing. The model was correct when opened in the application on the computer so next steps involved slicing, choosing a printer and material and further adjustment. We used recommended settings when choosing the layer height as well as support for areas that could potentially fail in the printing. Support was needed between the arms as well as under the part of the cone that exceeded the boundary of the holes. This can be seen in the picture below.  </p>
                            
                             <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/undir_an.jpg" width ="300" 
                            height="350"/></center>
                        
                            
                            <p>When all the adjustments had been made to the file, it was moved to the printer with a chip where we had already placed the material. It was also recommended to put some glue on the printer board so it would not get ruined when removing the printed object after the printing. The glue is weaker than the material on the plate. Finally we pressed ok and the Staupamælir was ready within four hours.  </p>
                            
                            
                            <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>There are a few things I would have done differently in my design if I would repeat the process, but this being my first design for  a 3D printer I am satisfied with the outcome. The main problem, which is big if we only look at the purpose of the design, is that it does not pour equally into all the glasses. It matters how you pour into the main body. This can be prevented in a few ways and the first one would have been to have the arms on the sides not on the bottom, like my design was in the beginning. That way the liquor would flow into the arm at the same time and in the same amount. Another way would have been to have the arms much thinner, this would inhibit the flow so it would accumulate in the bottom and likely flow equally into each glass. </p>
                            
                            <p>Here below is a video from the annual festival that I uploaded on youtube - even though the design was far from perfect it was a great success in this social setting.</p> 
                            
                            <center><a href="https://youtu.be/AzcJU8dywWs" class="button" target = "_blank">Staupajafnari in action</a></center>
                                
                            
                                

                            
                        
                            <h1>3D scanner</h1>
                            <p>Here the process of 3D scanning a chair using an application on an ipad will be described in detail.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Idea</h2>
                            <p>I was not sure how I was going to implement this part of the assignment, mainly because I had never tried to 3D scan before. I searched on the internet and found a wide variety of methods to 3D scan and the problem became one that involved choosing between them. I discussed this with my classmates and one of them pointed out an application that was easy to use and gave good outcomes. The application is called Polycam, the button below takes you to an online website where it is possible to 3D scan.</p>
                            
                             <center><a href="https://poly.cam/" class="button" target = "_blank">Polycam online</a></center>
                                
                           <p>I decided to 3D scan the chair that I spend most of the day sitting on.</p> 
                            
                            <h2>Scanning and the outcome</h2>
                            <p>Here below is a picture that contains each step and a short description for each. </p>

                             <ol>
                                <li>Press the plus sign to start a new project</li>
                                <li>Click the button that the arrows point to start the scanning. In this step you are required to move around the chair and get all aspects of it. Don’t move too fast. When you are satisfied you press it again and the scanning stops.</li>
                                <li>Press the process button and the application begins processing the pictures from step 2. </li>
                                <li>This step is not mandatory but if you wish to cut out things from the environment you press the crop button, this takes you to step 5. </li>
                                <li>Here you press on a plane of choice and this allows you to move it back or forth. In this way you can erase things that are trivial. When you are satisfied you press the crop button and you are all done!</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                           <p>Finally, here below you can see the outcome.</p>

                            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
                            <p>I would see that this went relatively considering the simplicity of the application. The result might have been more vivid if there would have been less of other things surrounding it. If I repeat this process with this particular method, I will choose a bigger object and place it in a space that is empty. </p>
