							<h1>3D printer</h1>
							<p>Assignment 3 consisted of 2 parts. Firstly, the students were to make a drawing in a software of their own choice that should then be 3D printed in Fab Lab. First they pick a printer and do a test that should reveal the constraint on their design. That is how detailed the design can be in relation to angles, thickness and so on. Furthermore it should not have been possible to use the method of milling to make it. Secondly the students were to  3D scan something. </p>
                            
                            <h2> Staupajafnari </h2>
                            <p>Again, I wanted to make something that I could make use of. Around the time of assignment 3 the student association began to sell tickets to their annual festival. This idea came right away 
                            and I simply opened Fusion 360 and began drawing where I had a rather clear idea of the design. It took a couple of tries before I was satisfied but here you can see the final outcome. This is a device that pours equally into 4 shot glasses at a time. </p>

                            <h2>Design process</h2>
                            
                            <p>I wanted to keep the design simple and clean but it was harder to achieve than I had expected. As I mentioned earlier I tried a few designs before I came up with the one I was satisfied with. Here below you can see one of these designs but the difference is that the arms that guide the liquor into the glasses are located on different  parts of the main body. Looking back, I see that that design could have been more successful than the one I chose. That will be discussed in the result part. </p>

                            height="300"/> </center>       
                            
                            <p>The way I drew this particular design is similar to the way I drew the one I picked in the end but this is done with the revolve method. The picture below describes it best.  </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/revolve.png" width ="500" 
                            height="250"/></center>
                            
                            <p>This is a clever feature when you want to design your own form, it can go from a very basic cylinder to a complexed form in a simple way. Like I said before I wanted to keep the design simple and clean so all the designs I tried were rather basic like the one here above. 
                            I chose a slightly different shape than the cylinder, like you can see in the pictures below. In this edition the arms simply come down from the bottom side. When I had made the body I drew four circles on the bottom side and used the cut extrude feature to make holes for the arms. To make the arms I made another sketch where I drew circles with the same diameter as the holes and used the extrude feature again, now “extrude from surface” instead of the “cut extrude” feature. The final touch was a cone situated inside the body, between the holes for the arms. The cone should guide all of the liquor into the arms so no liquor would remain in the body. Here below is a picture of the design where it is possible to see all parts.</p>

                            <h2>Printer test</h2>
                            <p>We chose the Prusa MK3+ printer and performed the test on that particular printer.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Preperation and printing</h2>
                            <p>As mentioned before, the name of the printer I chose was the Prusa MK3+ printer. At the time I printed my design there was only one type of material available so I picked that. It was really convenient, because that particular material should be used when liquids are involved. It does not leak. The button below takes you to a site that contains information about the printer.  </p>
                            
                            <center><a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-i3-mk3s/" class="button" target = "_blank">Prusa MK3+</a></center>
                            
                            <p>When the drawing was ready in Fusion 360 I took my computer to Fab Lab where Hafliði, the teacher of the course, helped me to prepare my design for the printing. Here I will not go into this part of the process in detail, mainly because I have no pictures to show. On my computer I saved the file containing my design as a 3MF file which I then  moved to the computer in Fab Lab via USB. The file was opened in the computer where a few things needed to be adjusted before the printing. The model was correct when opened in the application on the computer so next steps involved slicing, choosing a printer and material and further adjustment. We used recommended settings when choosing the layer height as well as support for areas that could potentially fail in the printing. Support was needed between the arms as well as under the part of the cone that exceeded the boundary of the holes. This can be seen in the picture below.  </p>
                            
                             <center><img src ="Staupamaelir/undir_an.jpg" width ="300" 
                            height="350"/></center>
                        
                            
                            <p>When all the adjustments had been made to the file, it was moved to the printer with a chip where we had already placed the material. It was also recommended to put some glue on the printer board so it would not get ruined when removing the printed object after the printing. The glue is weaker than the material on the plate. Finally we pressed ok and the Staupamælir was ready within four hours.  </p>
                            
                            
                            <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>There are a few things I would have done differently in my design if I would repeat the process, but this being my first design for  a 3D printer I am satisfied with the outcome. The main problem, which is big if we only look at the purpose of the design, is that it does not pour equally into all the glasses. It matters how you pour into the main body. This can be prevented in a few ways and the first one would have been to have the arms on the sides not on the bottom, like my design was in the beginning. That way the liquor would flow into the arm at the same time and in the same amount. Another way would have been to have the arms much thinner, this would inhibit the flow so it would accumulate in the bottom and likely flow equally into each glass. </p>
                            
                            <p>Here below is a video from the annual festival that I uploaded on youtube - even though the design was far from perfect it was a great success in this social setting.</p>
