							<h1>How to make a website</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images\project1b.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This was the first time I worked with html so I had to gain basic knowledge on the subject. First I watched an introduction that the teacher posted with the outline of the project. This button will get you to the introduction videos. </p>
                            <center><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU4NWxEpJJumoJghcC5V3rjv0_VHE7IQr" class="button" target = "_blank">Introduction videos</a></center>
                            <p>First I downloaded applications and files needed for the project. This was Brackets and Git and then a template of a html5 site found here:  <a href = "https://html5up.net/"/a target = "_blanck">html5up.net</a>. When choosing the template for my website, I downloaded templates that caught my eye and looked at the html files associated with each one. I found the code behind the Phantom template convenient and the look of the page clean, so I decided to choose that one.</p>
                            <p>Brackets is an open source text editor which is found to be both modern and powerful. Github is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git and is often used when working with open-source projects. These buttons will get you to websites where it is possible to download these applications.</p>
                            <center><a href="https://brackets.io/" class="button" target = "_blank">Download Brackets</a>  <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="button" target = "_blank">Download Git</a></center>
                            
                            <p>When everything was set up on my computer I began designing my website. I found good use in the inspection feature where it is possible to see how the page changes when you change the code behind it. To do this you right click on your mouse and chose inspect. </p>
                            <center><img src ="mynd_inspect.png" width="550" 
                            height="350"/> </center>       
                            
                            <p>By doing this there should a small inspection window appear on the right site of your page.</p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="mynd_inspect_gluggi.png" width ="200" 
                            height="350"/></center>
                            
                            <p>To be able to see the permanent changes made when changing the code in Brackets I clicked the lightning in the right upper corner of the page, where the arrows point on the picture below. </p>
                             <center><img src ="mynd_elding.png" width ="700" 
                            height="350"/></center>
                            
                            <p> When I began to alter the style of the page I tried to make the design represent me as a person without overshadowing the purpose of the page, where this page is a platform for projects I have worked on. The first thing that came to mind was to have pictures from my photo library somewhere on the page - I have always loved taking pictures. I was not sure where I wanted them to be or if I needed to find pictures that had some relations to the projects. I tried to insert some pictures and finally decided that the pictures should not serve any other purpose than just being there and making the page pretty. This way I might insert or remove pictures along with the documentations of upcoming projects. The picture on the top of this documentation is taken on my farm in Skeiða- og Gnúpverjahreppur, where we look over the land of Stóri Núpur and Ásar.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Even though I made a rather big effort to make my website look nice I also wanted it to be simple and clear in use. There is an option to open a bar in the right corner of every page. There you are granted an option to change your location on the website, for example to go back to the front page or even enter another project. The sign that shows three lines on the picture below gives access to the bar. </p>
                            <center><img src ="mynd_bar.png" width ="700" 
                            height="300"/></center>
                            
                            <p>The bar differs between locations so it is designed separately for each page of the website. This is done by making changes to the menu section in the html file associated with each page. Here below you can see pictures of the menu section in the project3.html file.</p>
                            <center><img src ="mynd_menu.png" width ="550" 
                            height="200"/></center>
                            
                            <p>I played a bit more with the look of the bar. The final outcome can be seen in the pictures below, where the code is in the first picture and than the look of the bar for project1.html file when it has been opened in the second one.</p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="mynd_bar2.png" width ="550" 
                            height="200"/></center>
                            
                            <center><img src ="mynd_menu2.png" width ="500" 
                            height="600"/></center>
                            
                            
                            <p>When I was satisfied with the look of my website I made an account on Github. Next step was to make a new repository but this was the first time I worked with Git so it took three times to upload all the files associated with my website. The repository that stores my website has the name TF_VEL608G. In the picture below you can see where it is possible to make a new repository and the three repositories I made for this project. </p>
                             <center><img src ="images/repositories.png" width ="750" 
                            height="400"/></center>
                            
                            
                            <p>When the new repository was opened Github gave a code that I pasted into Git Bash, but first I had to open Git Bash in the same folder as my website. Soon after my website was ready to view!</p>
