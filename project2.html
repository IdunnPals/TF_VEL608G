							<h1>Laser cutter</h1>
							<p>Assignment 2 consisted of two separate tasks. Firstly, students were supposed to design press-fit units for an assembly that should be printed in a Laser cutter. The design needed to be parametric where length, width and heights should be adjustable. Secondly, a vinyl cutter should be used to make a sticker.  </p>
                            <h2> Svínínan </h2>
                            <p>Around the time the class began to work on assignment 2 my little cousin had her 3 year old birthday. I decided right away that I wanted to make a birthday present for her and began my search on the internet for ideas. There were a couple of ideas that I wrote down but in the end I could narrow them down to two ideas. The decision was somewhat harder than I expected. This led to the design of a toy that was a combination of two toys. Here below you can see a picture of the Svínína, or in english the bunny-pig. The description of the Svínína would be a 3D puzzle of a bunny-pig hybrid. Here you can see the Svínína. </p>

                            height="350"/> </center>
                            <center><img src ="svin_hlid.jpg" width=250 
                            height="350"/> </center>
                            
                            <h2>Design process</h2>
                            
                            <p>When I had roughly decided what I was going to design I opened my ipad and began to make sketches. This was one of the most time consuming parts of the assignment where all sizes had to add up and ways found to make the design parametric. Here below you can see late drafts. </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="svin_skissa.png" width="550" 
                            height="350"/> </center>       
                            
                            <p>When I was satisfied with the outcome I moved the sketches to Fusion 360 where I drew the parts. Each part was drawn in a separate file where each was extruded and assigned its parameters. When all the parts were ready, an assembly was made where all the parts were imported to one file and constrained together in the same manner as would be done in reality. Here below is a picture of the assembly. </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Gris_myndir/Samsetning1_gris.png" width ="400" 
                            height="350"/></center>
                            
                            <p>It is worth mentioning here that some features of the design were altered when the parts were drawn in Fusion 360. </p>
                            
                            <h2>Parts, press-fit and parameterization</h2>
                            
                            <p>Firstly you can see a picture of all the parts of the assembly aligned in the same file here below.  </p>
                            
                             <center><img src ="Gris_myndir/align.png" width ="500" 
                            height="300"/></center>
                            
                            <p>few crucial things to have in mind when defining the parameters because a small alteration could lead to a fatal fate for the toy. Two examples would be; an increase of the body but not the chest would result in a situation where the hybrid could not stand or widening of the two pins that stick the nose and head together, would result in a hybrid without nose. To prevent this I defined each parameter in an appropriate file where each was assigned the same name. I also discovered that it would make the design more solid if the sizes of the joints were held fixed but their position adjustable. This was possible to do by going to the “modify” tab and selecting “change parameters” and then a table like the one below should appear. </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Gris_myndir/parametrar.png" width ="600" 
                            height="250"/></center>
                            
                            <p>By clicking the + sign it is possible to add parameters. These particular parameters are the ones used in all the files where all dimensions are fractions/combinations of these parameters.
                            This was the first time I designed something with a press-fit feature so I wanted to seek some guidance. Searching on the internet led me to a site that was rather simple and gave me a good start point. The bottom below sends you to this site: 
                            </p>

                            <h2>Kerf</h2>
                            
                            <p>A part of assignment 2 was a group assignment, where 3 people should measure the kerf on the laser cutter used in the main assignment. For this task, Guðný, Iðunn and Íris formed a group. </p>
                            
                            <p>Generally the word kerf refers to the groove or slit made by the blade of a cutting tool, in our case the slit made by a laser cutter. This part was crucial because the press-fit required preciseness in measures in order to function as it should.</p>
                            
                            <ol>
                                <li>10 rectangles were drawn in Fusion 360, each 1cmx1cm</li>
                                <li>The drawing was saved and exported to Inkscape where line thickness was adjusted, 2mm in our case. </li>
                                <li>The file was saved as a SVG file and exported to the Laser cutter via USB </li>
                                <li>The cutter was prepared for the cutting with help from Hafliði, the teacher of the course, and the cutting process initiated. The material used was birch plywood.</li>
                                <li>Before taking the cubes out we made red dots on the side that faced up and finally removed them from the cutter</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>Below you can see a picture of the cubes.</p>
                            <center><img src ="Gris_myndir/kerf_an.jpg" width ="250" 
                            height="250"/></center>
                            
                            <p>Now we could measure the kerf by hand. This was simply done by placing them side by side and they pressed together. In the picture below you can see a gap that forms when this is done. </p>
                            
                            <center><img src ="Gris_myndir/kerf_med.jpg" width ="250" 
                            height="250"/></center>
                            
                            <p>This gap was measured and the resulting number divided by eleven, the number of parallel cutting lines. This gave us a kerf of the size 0,01636364cm.</p>
                            
                            
                            
                            <h2>Final preparation</h2>
                            <p>We could choose between two materials for the cuttin, these materials were 4mmx500mmx500mm birch plywood  and 3mmx500mmx500mma kril. I chose the former one. Here below the steps needed to cut out the drawing are listed.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Export the drawing to Inkscape as a DXF file. This is done by saving the file as a DXF file and opening it in Inkscape. Before exporting, it is necessary to adjust the kerf in the file.</li>
                                <li>Adjust line features for the drawing in Inkscape.</li>
                                <li>Save the file on a form that the laser cutter can read. Here the file was saved as a PDF file that was then imported to the laser cutter via USB.</li>
                                <li>Adjust the settings on the cutter and place the material in the cutter. Here I sought guidance from the teacher where he was familiar with this specific cutter. </li>
                                <li>Press the start button </li>
                            
                            </ol>
                            <p>It can happen that another round of cutting is needed because the laser does not get through the material for all the parts. That was not the case for me so I simply opened the cutter, took the parts out and pressed them together. My design was ready. </p>
                            
                            <h2>Thoughts</h2>
                            <p>It is good practice to print a test, that could be one part of the press-fit for example, to be sure that it works as it should. When I got to Fab Lab to cut out my design there were alot of other students on the same task. This resulted in me forgetting to test my press-fit. I was lucky that the kerf test that we performed was accurate and all the parts went well together. 
                            If I would redo this design I would change one feature and that is the tail. The press-fit feature does not work properly where the joint is too wide. Overall I am happy with the design.
                            </p>

                            
                        
                            <h1>Vinyl cutter</h1>
                            <p>For this part of the assignment I decided that I wanted to make  a sticker of the Lacoste crocodile. The only constraints were that the cutting area should not exceed 100x50cm. The process was as follows: </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Find a black and white picture, preferably,  of what you want to cut out or simply draw it yourself. Save it on your computer. </li>
                                <li>Open your file in Inkscape where it will be saved as a PDF file. </li>
                                <li>Go to the Path tab in the top of the page and press Trace bitmap. Here you will need to hover over the design. When this step has been taken, remove the original one out of the file. </li>
                                <li>Adjust the Fill and Stroke settings for your cutter and send the file to Vinyl cutter via USB.</li>
                                <li>Press the start button </li>
                            
                            </ol>
                            <p>I have not yet decided where I want the sticker to be so I have not gone through that process. What the teacher recommended was to tape the surface and remove the glue protection. Now pick a surface and stick it on that surface, now the glue on the sticker is stronger then the glue on the tape so it is simply possible to pull it off where the sticker will remain on the surface. Ready!</p>
